740 Delete and Earn
https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/description/

You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 104

Solution:
1. Brute Force (Recursion): At each element, we have two choices: delete or skip. We do this recursively for each element. Thus for N elements, we have a worst case scenario of 2^N possibilities.
Time: O(2^N), Space: O(N)

2. Tabulation (bottom-up approach): We construct a 1-D dp[] array and maintain a hash map to preserve the counts of each element. We define:
dp[i] = max score earned until ith element (curr element) of array, i.e. A[i-1].
      = max(max score from deleting curr element, max score from not deleting curr element)

      = if A[i-1]-1 == A[i-2]:  (curr = A[i-1], prev = A[i-2], pprev = A[i-3])
            yes: max(score from deleting curr + max score from deleting pprev,
                 max score from deleting prev)
            no: max(score from deleting curr + max score from deleting prev,
                 max score from deleting prev)

      = yes: max(count(A[i-1])*A[i-1] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])
        no:  max(count(A[i-1])*A[i-1] + dp[i-1], dp[i-1])

Step 0: init dp[0] = 0 (max score is 0 before starting to delete)
             dp[1] = count(A[0])*A[0] (score earned from deleting 0th ele)

Step 1: for i:2...N-1, compute dp[i]

Step 2: return dp[N]

Time: O(N log N + N) = O(N log N), Space: O(2N) = O(N)
O(N log N) to sort the array + O(N) to populate the dp array
